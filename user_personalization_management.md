### User Personalization Options

This will allow users to define their ideal AI news experience with granular control over the following:

#### 1. Core Topic Selection
Users will first select the foundational, broad topics on which their personalized newsletter will be generated. This acts as the primary filter, ensuring the content aligns with their main areas of interest.

*   **Examples:** Generative AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, AI Ethics, Robotics, AI in Healthcare, AI in Finance, Autonomous Systems, Edge AI, Quantum AI, etc.


#### 2. Content Type Preference

Beyond just general topics, users can specify the *type* or *format* of AI news they are most interested in, even within their chosen core topics. This provides a finer level of filtering and personalization, ensuring the delivered content matches their specific professional or academic focus.

*   **Industry News:** Focus on broad industry developments, company strategies, business models, and the overall landscape of the AI sector.
*   **Investments, Announcements & Market Trends:** Specific updates on venture capital funding, partnerships, mergers & acquisitions (M&A), IPOs, significant corporate announcements, and overarching market shifts or analyses impacting AI.
*   **Conferences and Events:** Summaries and key takeaways from major AI conferences, industry summits, webinars, and other significant events.
*   **Research & Breakthroughs:** Highlights from new academic papers, significant scientific discoveries, algorithm advancements, and experimental results, often focusing on the bleeding edge of AI innovation.

*   **Case Studies & Comparison Studies:** Detailed analyses of how AI is being applied in real-world scenarios, success stories, practical implementations, or comparative analyses of different AI solutions, models, or technologies.




#### 2. Desired Summary Format/Depth
Users can control how detailed and technical the AI-generated summaries should be, beyond their general expertise level.

<!-- #### Part-1 (Only Beginner) -->

<!-- ####   **Translate Technical Jargon into Layman's Terms:** (Especially relevant for Beginner persona) Simplifies complex technical vocabulary for easier understanding. -->

#### Part-1 (This length not Depth)
