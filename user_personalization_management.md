### Enhanced User Personalization Options

This will allow users to define their ideal AI news experience with granular control over the following:

#### 1. Content Type Preference
Beyond just general topics, users can specify the *type* of AI news they are most interested in.
*   **Industry News / Business Insights:[Part-1]** Focus on market trends, company announcements, investments, and practical applications of AI in various sectors.
*   **Research Papers (Technical/Academic):[Part-2]** For those who want deep dives into new algorithms, methodologies, and scientific breakthroughs.


#### 2. Desired Summary Format/Depth
Users can control how detailed and technical the AI-generated summaries should be, beyond their general expertise level.

<!-- #### Part-1 (Only Beginner) -->

<!-- ####   **Translate Technical Jargon into Layman's Terms:** (Especially relevant for Beginner persona) Simplifies complex technical vocabulary for easier understanding. -->

#### Part-1 (This length not Depth)
*   **Brief Bullet Points:** Quick, scannable summaries focusing on main ideas.
*   **Short Paragraph Summaries:** Concise, narrative overviews of each article.
*   **Detailed Executive Summaries:** More comprehensive summaries, akin to a longer abstract.


#### 3. Frequency and Delivery Time
Users can customize when and how often they receive their digest or alerts.
*   **Daily Digest:** A more frequent, potentially shorter newsletter delivered every day.
*   **Specific Day/Time:** For example, "Every Monday at 9:00 AM EST" or "Friday afternoon digest."
*   **Urgent Alerts Only:** Opt-in to receive immediate notifications only for major breakthrough news, bypassing regular digests.

#### 4. Source Prioritization/Exclusion
Users can exert control over the origins of their news.
*   **Prioritize Specific Sources:** Users can indicate a preference for articles from certain platforms (e.g., Medium, Dev.to) or respected publications/blogs.
