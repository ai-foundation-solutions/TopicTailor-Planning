### User Personalization Options

Users can define their ideal AI news experience with granular control over the following dimensions:

#### 1. Core Topic Selection
**Step 1: Select Core Topics**
- Users choose foundational, broad topics for their personalized newsletter. This acts as the primary filter, ensuring content aligns with their main interests.
- *Examples:* Generative AI, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, AI Ethics, Robotics, AI in Healthcare, AI in Finance, Autonomous Systems, Edge AI, Quantum AI, etc.

#### 2. Content Type Preference
**Step 2: Choose Content Type Preferences**
- Users specify the *type* or *format* of AI news they prefer, even within their chosen core topics. This provides a finer level of filtering and personalization.
- *Options include:*
    - **Industry News:** Broad developments, company strategies, business models, and sector landscape.
    - **Investments, Announcements & Market Trends:** VC funding, partnerships, M&A, IPOs, major announcements, and market analyses.
    - **Conferences and Events:** Summaries and key takeaways from major events, summits, and webinars.
    - **Research & Breakthroughs:** Highlights from academic papers, discoveries, algorithm advancements, and experimental results.
    - **Product Releases & Benchmarks:** News on new software, hardware, platforms, services, and performance metrics.
    - **Case Studies & Comparison Studies:** Real-world applications, success stories, practical implementations, and comparative analyses.

#### 3. Topic Expertise & Technicality
**Step 3: Set Topic Expertise & Technicality**
- For each selected topic, users indicate their familiarity level:
    - *Beginner:* Prefers high-level explanations, minimal jargon.
    - *Intermediate:* Comfortable with common terms, concise technical detail.
    - *Advanced/Expert:* Familiar with research papers, ~~math~~, implementation details; prefers technical language.
- Users can set a global default and override specific topics (e.g., "Global: Intermediate, but 'Generative AI': Advanced").
- ~~Optional~~ stylistic aids per topic:
    - Translate jargon to lay terms
    - ~~Include code snippets (Python/PyTorch) when relevant~~
    - ~~Add math notations and key equations~~
    - Provide citations/links to papers and benchmarks (must)
    - Add glossaries or "Why it matters" callouts (not so important, but can be added for beginner level preference so that even if the users have less knowledge of it, they can just get the idea of the impact of the article)
- ~~Quick self-assessment sliders (1â€“5) for comfort with math, code, and research papers to fine-tune output.~~
- *Impact:* Vocabulary, summary tone, and context framing adapt to the selected level.

#### 4. Frequency and Delivery Time
**Step 4: Set Frequency and Delivery Time**
- Users customize when and how often they receive their digest or alerts.
    - *Specific Day/Time:* e.g., "Every Monday at 9:00 AM EST" or "Friday afternoon digest."
    - ~~*Daily Digest (optional):* More frequent, shorter newsletter delivered every day.~~
    - ~~*Urgent Alerts Only (optional):* Immediate notifications for major breakthrough news, bypassing regular digests.~~

#### ~~5. Privacy Controls & Data Usage~~
- ~~Users can review and manage what data is used for personalization.~~
    - ~~*Options:* Opt-in/out of data collection, view/edit personalization profile, request data deletion.~~
